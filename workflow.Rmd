```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Pull the current month from google sheets

```{r}
library(googlesheets)
(my_sheets <- gs_ls())
devtools::install_github('maczokni/selfquant')
library(dplyr)
library(selfquant)

sq_data <- getQuant()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
